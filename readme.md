<h1>PREVIEW</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Watcher</h2>

<p>"The Watcher" is the website of a fictitious bookstore, selling selected pieces of horror literature, ranging from the gothic era to the modern age! The project is still ongoing, so please bear with me, for a little longer!</p>

<h2>On the back end</h2>
<p>The website has been built using Laravel 5.8. In addition, I have been using the <a href="https://laravelvoyager.com" class="text-bordeaux">Voyager</a> multipurpose admin panel for backend functionality just because it seemed awesome and I wanted to try iy out! (It really IS awseome by the way!) This means, that besides some basic stuff, many back end features have been implemented directly from Voyager rather than from inside Laravel. For example, the database tables, have been initially created with php artisan, but afterwards, all changes have been made exclusively with Voyager, though some table relations have been implemented in the Laravel models as well.</p>
<p>The project is not yet completed. The main missing feature is the order model. At the moment order data do not persist on the database, mainly because I wanted to exclude it from the demo in order to avoid potentional spam or abuse. But without the model the site misses important functionality, such as order history and mailables. So the next step is to take care of that and implement also some extra features, such as order printout with the DOMPDF extension and perhaps a payment gateway with Stripe.</p> 

<h2>Regarding the content</h2>
<p>The bookstore was designed with a front-end first mindset. That means the visual part was designed first, in order to give more authenticity to the project. Thus, all titles are real. The selection as well as the description text have been taken 'as is' from pastemagazine's list of The 50 Best Horror Novels of All Time. Feel free to visit the collection and read the articles if you are interested in horror literature. You can find the original complete list <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/08/the-best-horror-novels-of-all-time.html">here</a>.
The authors' biographies have been taken from wikipedia and their photos from random sites on the web. I do not own any rights of this content, I used it only as a sample. All prices are imaginary, just to fill in the necessary product info for the e-commerce functionality.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment if you think something should have been done otherwise and visit the site as soon as is comes online!</p>
